CBC in 16-byte mode is different than just using a half of a 16-byte key


Triple-DES is just DES with two 56-bit keys applied. Given a plaintext message

* the first key is used to DES-encrypt the message
* the second key is used to DES-decrypt the encrypted message
* the twice-scrambled message is then encrypted again with the first key

i.e. Triple DES is 8-byte
