#### AES encryption and decryption

I did a complete overhaul of the pages about math for AES, but I haven't done new write-ups about the steps in encryption and decryption.  The old explanations are still fine.

I did tweak all the code.  It's in ``code-new``.  It could be better organized, perhaps.

In any event, I can generate the output from [this source](sources/AES.pdf) and also ``decrypt(encrypt(p))`` gives p again.

The old pages are:

- [part 1](pages-old/AES1-Intro.md)
- [part 2](../AES-math/README.old.md)
- [part 3](pages-old/AES3-key.md)
- [part 4](pages-old/AES4-encrypt.md)

The did write a new page on 

- [key expansion](pages/key-expansion.md)
